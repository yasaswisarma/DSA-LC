//1344. Angle Between Hands of a Clock
//Approach-1: 1.  formulae for angle between hour and minute hand is modulus|30*hour-5.5*minutes|
//            2.  if angle is greater than 180 then we need to subtract it from 360

//Approach-2: 1.  find angle made by hour hand with 12 o'clock => (30*hour + 0.5*minutes)*30 
//            2.  find angle made by minute hand with 12 o'clock => (6*minutes)*6
//            3.  find the difference between the two angles and if it is greater than 180 then we need to subtract it from 360
